# React Hooks - Context API 

Based in [this](https://medium.com/reactbrasil/entendendo-a-context-api-do-react-criando-um-componente-de-loading-a84f84007dc7) article,
I created this project using functions instead class-components to demonstrate how to works with context api.

## Start

Open a Terminal, navigate to the project folder and type:
```
yarn
yarn start
```
